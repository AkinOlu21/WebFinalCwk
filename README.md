Project Description
The Hospital Management System is a system designed to simplify the task of medical records management, appointment scheduling and user accounts management for healthcare facilities. It focuses on improving the efficiency and security in the management of medical records, thus allowing doctors and patients to access the records to the utmost necessary level in terms of content and information.


Goals and Functionalities
 Active and Transparent Medical Record Management: 
At the heart of the system lies the ability to allow faster workflow management of patient medical records, by allowing better medical record creation, health record retention and updating.
 Appointment Scheduling: 
The system allows users to book, review and cancel appointments with their doctors. This feature is very user-friendly to secure smoother communication between patients and doctors. 

User Authentication and Authorization:
 Token-based Authorization using JWT tokens, and the utilisation of the Microsoft Identity Framework was implemented to ensure all users are authenticated and authorised. This protects the privacy of each patient’s data and information. In addition to doctors, data about nurses and patients are also well taken care of by the system: as it manages nurses and patients end to end, from contact data up to specialisations. 

Email Notifications:
 The system extends interactions and engagement with users by sending an automated email, in this case when a user signs up.



Technologies Used

 Backend: 
The hospital management system is built on Microsoft’s .NET Core, making the backend service robust and scalable to handle large sets of complex data whilst conforming to the desired business logic.

 Database Management:
SQLite Server is utilized to store content securely to accommodate for a high volume of stored data. 

Security:
The use of JWT tokens together with the Identity Framework enables a good security solution, enabling a safe environment for user interaction and data management.

Deployment:
Deployment on Microsoft’s Azure cloud commitment to scalability, reliability and security ensures that the system can meet the evolving needs of today’s healthcare facilities.


In conclusion, the HealthCare Management System is a system which aims to modernise healthcare management through recent technology and excellent thinking. It is focused on efficiency, safety, and service caring for mental issues making it an important technique for people in the healthcare area who are looking for more warmth in its service delivery and operational efficiency.


In V1 of the Web project, The project is made in the context of a hospital context with the models for doctor, patients, nurses, appointments and medical records added.
